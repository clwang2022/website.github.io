I am a postdoctoral fellow at Dalla Lana school of public health, University of Toronto.

I'm an interdisciplinary researcher with expertise in spatial analysis and quantitative research. My career goal is to build up the power of interdisciplinary study across public health, geography, and implementation science in advancing the knowledge and promoting the development of healthy city.
